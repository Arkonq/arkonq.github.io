        <h2 class="content__title">Online learning - what is it?</h2>
        <div class="content__text">
          <p>Online learning is the acquisition of knowledge which involves the use of various electronic gadgets (computer, phone etc.) with Internet access in the learning process. Thanks to this format of education it is possible to study without leaving home. Both school and vocational education can be done in this way. </p>
          <p>Education can be delivered from the comfort of one's bed via a computer, smartphone or even a smart TV. This is a particular problem for residents of eastern cities, which have very cold winters or no conditions for building schools (let alone institutes). Thanks to advances in technology, even specialisation can be obtained online - through online courses. </p>
          <p>It won't be that hard to find them - the specialized sites are immediately listed by the search engine, and the online course advertisements, with the help of the targeting algorithm, find the applicants in time. Classes with a tutor via Skype, Viber and other communication services also qualify as online learning, by the way, because there's no direct human contact.
        </div>
        <h3 class="content__subtitle">The benefits of online learning:</h3>
        <ul class="content__list">
          <li>Accessibility - you can study from anywhere in the world. All you need is an electronic device with an internet connection. You can also plan your own timetable;</li>
          <li>Unlimited time to complete assignments - teachers do not usually set deadlines, but you should not procrastinate; </li>
          <li>Online learning saves time. First of all, you don't have to travel anywhere specifically. Even if the classroom is in your city, it is not always located in a convenient place. If you choose distance learning, everything is at your fingertips. And the released time can be spent on repeating the material again. After all, we all remember that repetition is the mother of learning.</li>
          <li>Can be an excellent complement to offline courses.</li>
          <li>You can always listen to the lecture again - online schools have the equipment to store recordings of the streams and webinars so that students can review and repeat the material; </li>
          <li>Access to information at any convenient time, all that is needed is a computer with internet access;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="content__subtitle">The disadvantages of online learning:</h3>
        <ul class="content__list">
          <li>Lack of discipline - if there is no willpower, it is very easy to give up studying, especially since teachers are not obliged to control the educational process;</li>
          <li>Lack of communication - chat rooms are no substitute for live dialogues with classmates, there is no opportunity to discuss the topics being studied, hear different points of view on a problem, work in a group, which does not allow you to form team communication skills.</li>
          <li>Lack of, or considerably less, practical experience.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>Platonus is an automated information system that enables comprehensive automation of credit and distance learning processes. The system has a centralised database in which all the actual events and processes of the university are reflected. For every student and staff member a so called "personal cabinet" (a personal web page) is provided, which enables the university staff to automate their main tasks, for students to see the necessary information, and for distance learning students to instantly get access to case studies and knowledge control, to communicate with a teacher in real-time through the Internet or an internal university network.</p>
          <p>Previously, students had access to the Platonus learning portal only from the university campus. Now there is round-the-clock access from anywhere in Astana, Kazakhstan and the world. The main thing is to have your login and password to enter your personal account.</p>

          <p>Moodle is a free and open source e-learning system. Over the years a strong community has developed around Moodle, which creates new modules (plugins) for the platform. A module is a ZIP archive that, when installed on the platform, adds new features or changes the design. Today Moodle is translated into more than 100 languages and supports over 1500 plugins.</p>
          <p>Moodle is suitable for both higher education institutions and training centres, as well as for corporate training. Moodle is relatively more complex to set up than commercial platforms. However, it can be more expensive to administer, at the cost of outsourcing and maintaining your own server.</p>

        <p>Offline learning</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="content__title">Offline learning - what is it?</h2>
      <div class="content__text">
        <p>Offline learning is traditional learning that takes place within an educational institution. Offline learning includes school education, vocational education and training, higher education or further education. Classes usually start in the morning and last for at least 5 hours.</p>
        <p>Off-line learning also includes classes with a tutor when a real meeting takes place - usually at one's home. In this case, of course, you don't have to interact with other students, but the material you learn is more limited, e.g. you prepare for international exams or Olympiads. The main task of the teacher in this case is not only to deliver the material but also to build a rapport with the pupil so that he or she wants to come back. </p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="content__subtitle">The benefits of offline learning:</h3>
      <ul class="content__list">
        <li>Discipline - Teachers will supervise the learning process, which will prevent the student from relaxing and "bogging down" in their studies. Regular and timely completion of homework will have a positive impact on future work; </li>
        <li>Eye contact and emotional rapport - the teacher is always willing to help when pupils are having difficulty with a task because he/she can see the difficulty, rather than expecting pupils to answer it.</li>
        <li>Feedback - during a classroom session, questions often arise about new material. In such cases, it is possible to ask the teacher a question directly and get an immediate answer;</li>
        <li>Networking - you can meet new people, find friends, share experience and knowledge.</li>
        <li>In a classroom, perception is faster because, in addition to the visual and auditory, associative memory and motor skills are also involved in the learning process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="content__subtitle">The disadvantages of offline learning:</h3>
      <ul class="content__list">
        <li>Limited - in a small town, there is unlikely to be a Chinese teacher willing to teach for a small fee.</li>
        <li>It will be more difficult to retrieve the material than in online learning. Teachers rarely record lectures, seminars on electronic media (cameras, dictaphones), so the missed course will have to be recovered by yourself or with the help of classmates.</li>
        <li>More time-consuming, because you have to spend time to get to the institution;</li>
        <li>Fixed schedule of classes.</li>

        <p>Blended learning</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="content__title">Blended learning - what is it?</h2>
      <div class="content__text">
        <p>Blended (blended, hybrid) learning is a form of education that combines elements of face-to-face and distance learning (online/e-learning). This form takes place when there are face-to-face classes with teachers in an educational institution, which are combined with e-learning in synchronous or asynchronous mode.</p>
        <p>The advantage of blended learning is that it allows for the development of a connection between student and instructor through face-to-face communication and at the same time provides flexibility of learning pace (students learn at their own pace, not at their workplace or with their family) and space (students learn regardless of location).</p>
        <p>At Nazarbayev University's Graduate School of Education, such a programme has been in place since 2014. This approach is otherwise known as "blended learning". Today, this method of learning is mainly used by master's students. They study on-the-job, have the opportunity to work at their schools or universities, but attend university three or four times a year for a fortnight at a time. The rest of the time the classes are self-directed, but at certain times students are in contact with teachers online.</p>
        <p>Blended learning is good because it is flexible enough to allow working students to have a quality study experience. Typically, most undergraduates and doctoral students are adults and families, and not everyone has the opportunity to leave their cities for long periods of time. Therefore, blended learning is not only popular with Kazakhstani students, but also around the world.</p>
        <p>There are also benefits of blended learning for pupils. It is already known that it is easier for pupils in schools which used a blended learning format before the quarantine began to adjust to learning in quarantine</p>
